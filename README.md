This is still a test version and it is mostly used for my minecraft obj loader animation system. There are many bugs and you currently can't upload your own models.

the javascript code can be made better... I am not that good at using js but i think this is a great practice! If you wan't to fork this you are free to do whatever you want with this.

Don't ask me why I made it in intellij instead of webstorm.
